- ## My Projects

### The World Bank — Banking App

A fully interactive banking application built in vanilla JavaScript. This project includes login with PIN, money transfers, loan requests, account closure, auto logout, real-time clock (with seconds), and localized date & currency formatting using the `Intl` API.

I worked on this project with guidance from my instructor, but built most of it myself — including all logic, styling, and debugging. It helped me understand session handling, data updates, and real-time UI feedback.

### FitnessMapApp — Workout Tracker with Interactive Map 🏃‍♀️📍
A fully functional workout tracker built with vanilla JavaScript. The app lets users log running and cycling workouts by clicking directly on a map, entering workout data, and saving it for later viewing.

This project uses the **Geolocation API** and **OOP** with classes to manage workouts, render markers on the map, calculate stats like speed, pace, and elevation gain, and store all data in LocalStorage.

It also includes **smooth transitions** between map markers, workout **validation**, **responsive design**, and a **reset functionality**. I followed an instructor's course while adding my own debugging and enhancements throughout the build.

### Alphabet Game  
My first interactive JavaScript game. The goal is to arrange shuffled letters into alphabetical order. I implemented click-based movement, DOM manipulation, and audio feedback.  
This project helped me understand logic, event handling, and debugging. I’m proud of finding and fixing all errors on my own.
