- ## My Projects

### The World Bank — Banking App

A fully interactive banking application built in vanilla JavaScript. This project includes login with PIN, money transfers, loan requests, account closure, auto logout, real-time clock (with seconds), and localized date & currency formatting using the `Intl` API.

I worked on this project with guidance from my instructor, but built most of it myself — including all logic, styling, and debugging. It helped me understand session handling, data updates, and real-time UI feedback.

### EcoVision  — an advanced responsive website promoting eco-initiatives and sustainable living.
This project features interactive card flip animations and a fully functional burger menu — all built using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).

### Alphabet Game  
My first interactive JavaScript game. The goal is to arrange shuffled letters into alphabetical order. I implemented click-based movement, DOM manipulation, and audio feedback.  
This project helped me understand logic, event handling, and debugging. I’m proud of finding and fixing all errors on my own.
